  Thank you for taking action with us to Own PG&E! Like many California residents, you’ve likely experienced the irresponsible and sometimes deadly actions PG&E has made, resulting in the pollution of our neighborhoods, power shut-offs, cutting off of services due to inability to pay, fires resulting in loss of homes and our skies being literally covered in smoke. 
</p>
<p>
  We’ve watched as PG&E has gone in and out of bankruptcy due to their mismanagement and lack of concern for the public that it serves—all while paying out their Wall St. shareholders and leaving people in the dark. PG&E has an astonishingly bad history and has escaped accountability for too long. For the sake of our communities, our neighbors, and our environment, we need to take ownership of PG&E!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Let’s Own PG&E is building a movement towards clean, safe, and affordable electricity for all Californians.</strong> We are a campaign of the Democratic Socialists of America and a coalition of other organizations across the Bay Area and PG&E’s territory.
</p>
<p>
  It’s time for Californians to take democratic control of this failing utility through state ownership and community control. To do this, we are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Teaching others about how the current system (doesn’t) work
  </li>
  <li>
    Sharing our plan across social and traditional media for a democratic, decarbonized, and decolonized future for PG&E
  </li>
  <li>
    Providing wildfire (and now COVID) masks for mutual aid
  </li>
  <li>
    Contacting our state legislators to demand a just transition
  </li>
  <li>
    Reaching out for support to rank and file workers at PG&E
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>You can join us!</strong>
